## ‚ö†Ô∏è STOP - Do Not Report Security Vulnerabilities Here

**Please DO NOT report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

### For Security Vulnerabilities:

1. **Use GitHub Security Advisories** (Preferred):

   - Go to the [Security tab](https://github.com/OscillateLabsLLC/simple-docker-manager/security)
   - Click "Report a vulnerability"
   - Fill out the private security advisory form

2. **Email** (Alternative):
   - Send details to: security@oscillatelabs.com
   - Include: description, reproduction steps, impact assessment

### For General Security Questions:

If this is a general security question (not a vulnerability), you can:

- Use GitHub Discussions for general questions
- Review our [Security Policy](../SECURITY.md)
- Check our security documentation in the README

### Why Private Reporting?

- Protects users while we develop a fix
- Follows responsible disclosure practices
- Allows us to coordinate with security researchers
- Prevents exploitation by malicious actors

Thank you for helping keep Simple Docker Manager secure! üõ°Ô∏è
